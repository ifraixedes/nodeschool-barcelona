5,5,5,5,5,The event was very practical and focused on coding. As a programmer I understand the best way to learn a technology is to work directly with it rather than watch slides. The event materials were very good.,Since the event takes 3 hours, perhaps a coding demo of 5-10 minutes can be done to learn Node specifics,10,5,1
